# treb.toml — Treb configuration
#
# Accounts define signing entities (wallets, hardware wallets, multisigs).
# Namespaces map roles to accounts for different environments.
# Namespaces support dot-separated names for hierarchical inheritance
# (e.g., "production.ntt" inherits from "production", which inherits from "default").

# --- Accounts ---
# Each [accounts.<name>] defines a named signing entity.

# --- Namespaces ---
# Each [namespace.<name>] maps roles to account names.
# The optional 'profile' key maps to a foundry.toml profile (defaults to namespace name).

# --- Fork Configuration ---
# Uncomment to configure fork setup script for treb dev commands.
